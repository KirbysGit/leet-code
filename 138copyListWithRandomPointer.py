    # bro i've been so fucking exhausted this morning i literally used
    # chatgpt to solve the problem and i still don't even know how to do it.

    # im coming back to this problem tmrw and i'll solve it on my own, i have
    # no recollection of what chatgpt told me so it will basically be 
    # starting out fresh!!

    # still super fucking tired right now so imma just pause.

    # idea was like two pass, one for list and one for random pointers.

    # in my initial attempt i was trying to understand how to use
    # a hashmap to store the nodes so i could reference them properly.
