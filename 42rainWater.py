    # bro i've been working on this for like 2 days, and im still so stuck. 
    
    # basically where im at is like i have the general approach of like finding the volumne
    # left over by the rain. but my issue is handling when i actually check. right now
    # im carrying two pointers where i only update the back if the front is > than the back.

    # so like i can find the valleys and do the math to find the water left over after displacement.

    # i just asked chatgpt for a hint but i don't know if its helping me that much.

    # i tried implementing a stack for the values and it worked for the two initial test cases but
    # now my code isn't hadnling the other ones as well. currently at 186 / 324 passed.
